## Installation
I used `uv` to manage my virtual environment while developing this project. To recreate my environment:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install uv ([link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)).
3. In the project directory type `uv sync`. This will create a virtual environment with the project's dependencies in `.venv`. 
4. Type `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
5. Type `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` to run the app locally.

## Modifying the App

The front end code is in `streamlit_app.py`.

The analytical code is in `backend.py`.
