In 2025 President Trump increased immigration enforcement in the
United States. This caused me to wonder what the baseline for immigration
enforcement was, and how much he was increasing it. This website is my attempt
to answer those questions.

The dataset this sites uses comes from the [ICE
Detainees](https://tracreports.org/immigration/detentionstats/pop_agen_table.html)
page from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) website. The
problem I had with the ICE Detainees page is that the data is presented as a
series of HTML tables with no visualizations. I created this website to visualize each subset of the data.  

This website caches data for one hour, and the ICE Detainees page seems to
update just a few times a month. So the website should normally have the latest data.

TRAC was not involved in the creation of this website. Please direct any
questions about the underlying data to TRAC.  

The code for this web app is open source and available [here](https://github.com/arilamstein/immigration_enforcement).
