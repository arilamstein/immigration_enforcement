In 2025 President Trump increased immigration enforcement in the
United States. This caused me to wonder what the baseline for immigration
enforcement was, and how much he was increasing it. This website is my attempt
to answer those questions.

The dataset this sites uses comes from the [ICE
Detainees](https://tracreports.org/immigration/detentionstats/pop_agen_table.html)
page from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) website. The
ICE Detainees page presents the data as a series of HTML tables. This website graphs each subset of the data.  

This website caches data for one hour. The ICE Detainees page, in turn, seems to
update just a few times a month. So the website should normally have the latest data.

This website is not affiliated with TRAC. Please direct any
questions about the underlying data to TRAC.
