# immigration_enforcement

This [app](https://immigration-enforcement.streamlit.app/) uses data from TRAC
Reports' [ICE
Detainees](https://tracreports.org/immigration/detentionstats/pop_agen_table.html)
page to help people understand how US immigration enforcement has changed over
time.

If you would like to run the app locally, or are interested in modifying it,
please read [DEVELOPER.md](/DEVELOPER.md). 

If you have any questions about the app, feel free to contact me via my [website](https://arilamstein.com/).
