This [app](https://immigration-enforcement.streamlit.app/) visualizes key datasets related to immigration enforcement in the United States. It was created to help people understand how enforcement levels have changed over timeâ€”especially in response to recent policy shifts.

The app currently includes two datasets:

- **ICE Detentions**: Periodic snapshots of detainee populations held in ICE facilities, sourced from [TRAC Reports](https://tracreports.org/immigration/detentionstats/pop_agen_table.html).
- **Border Patrol Encounters**: Combines year-to-date data from [Customs and Border Protection (CBP)](https://www.cbp.gov/document/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters) with historic data from the [Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS)](https://ohss.dhs.gov/khsm/cbp-encounters).

If you'd like to run the app locally or modify it, please read [DEVELOPER.md](/DEVELOPER.md).

The code is open source. If you have questions, feedback, or want to collaborate on similar projects, feel free to contact me via my [website](https://arilamstein.com).
